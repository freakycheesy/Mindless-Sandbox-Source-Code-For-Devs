# Mindless Sandbox Source Code For Devs
 - Game Link: https://pietrosprudente.itch.io/mindless-sandbox
 - This game is no longer being worked on so here is the source code
 - The code does not have an app id since I am not sharing it random people for logical reasons ._.
 - This game uses Photon Pun 2, if you did not make a Photon Realtime App ID then tick "StartInOfflineMode" to true!
 - IMPORTANT:
 - - Some Assets in the unity project are placeholders like audio, textures and, etc!
 - - Scrapped Custom Map editor works but it is bad as it depends on typing and not using vectors like a real game engine and save and loading does not work! 
 - - Also, the extra player textures were just placeholders to test usernames with custom skins!
